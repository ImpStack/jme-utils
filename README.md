# jme-utils
A utility library for jMonkeyEngine

## How to build ##
This library uses [gradle](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) as build system, and comes with the gradle wrapper included.
So no prior installation on your computer is required! You can just use the `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` executables in the root of the sources.

To run a full build, use:
```
./gradlew build
```

To get an overview of all gradle tasks use:
```
./gradlew tasks
```
